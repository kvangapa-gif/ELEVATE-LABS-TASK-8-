# 💬 Rule-Based Chatbot using If–Else

A simple Python chatbot built using basic control flow, loops, and input handling.

# 📌 Project Overview

This project is a rule-based chatbot created using Python.
# It uses:

if-elif-else statements

loops

input handling

functions

The chatbot can greet the user, tell jokes, provide motivation, and even chat freely based on keywords.

It is simple, beginner-friendly, and demonstrates the fundamentals of how early chatbots and NLP systems worked.

# 🎯 Features
# ✅ Menu-Based Interaction

The program displays a menu with multiple options:

1. Greet

2. Tell a Joke

3. Motivation

4. Free Chat

5. Exit

# ✅ Keyword-Based Free Chat

In free chat mode, the program responds based on input keywords like:

“hello”

“hi”

“joke”

“motivation”

“how are you”

# ✅ Functions for Clean Code

Each chatbot response is separated into its own function:

greet()

tell_joke()

motivate()

free_chat()

# ✅ Easy to Run

Works on:

VS Code

Terminal

Any Python environment

# 🧠 Concepts Used

This project covers basic programming concepts:

Control Flow (if/elif/else)

Loops (while True)

Input Handling (input())

Functions

Text processing (lower() for normalization)

These are the same fundamental ideas behind simple NLP chatbots.
